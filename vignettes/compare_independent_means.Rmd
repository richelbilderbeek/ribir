# Dataset

```{r}
set.seed(314)
n <- 30
scores1 <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 1, sd  = 0.5)
scores2 <- runif(n = n, min  = 0, max = 4.0)

df_same <- data.frame(
  score = c(scores1, scores1),
  treatment = c(rep(1, n), rep(2, n))
)

df_different <- data.frame(
  score = c(scores1, scores2),
  treatment = c(rep(1, times = n), rep(2, times = n))
)
df_different$treatment <- as.factor(df_different$treatment)
```

Taking a look at the dataset ..

as a histogram:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
ggplot2::ggplot(
  df_different,
  ggplot2::aes(x = df_different$score, fill = df_different$treatment)
) + ggplot2::geom_histogram(
  position = "identity",
  alpha = 0.5, ggplot2::aes(y = ..density..)
)
```

as a density plot:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
ggplot2::ggplot(
  df_different,
  ggplot2::aes(x = df_different$score, fill = df_different$treatment)
) + ggplot2::geom_density(
  alpha = 0.5
)
```

as both a histogram and density plot:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
ggplot2::ggplot(
  df_different,
  ggplot2::aes(x = df_different$score, fill = df_different$treatment)
) + ggplot2::geom_histogram(
  position = "identity",
  alpha = 0.5, ggplot2::aes(y = ..density..)
) + ggplot2::geom_density(
  alpha = 0.1
)
```
